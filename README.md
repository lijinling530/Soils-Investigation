# Soils-Investigation
This is a Machine Learning Project. Big data analytics are applied in soil investigation and urban planning. Dataset is obtained from open source as well as laboratory. Hadoop environment is set up, and read from datasource, generate Metastore tables, and then upload to Hive for cleaning and filtering. R and Python are used to load dataframe from database, and perform regression, PCA, clustering, and correlation analysis to determine soil properties. Finally visualization is implemented via R and Python libraries.

### Dataset
Part of the dataset is obtained from USDA Web Soil Survey:
